<h2>Mod Usage</h2>

K2-ExoticArmory is a mod that adds Destiny, by Bungie, themed weapons to a shop for you to use

Ada-1 will sell you a few miscellaneous items, she likes to camp out on the second floor of the Motel, otherwise, I've hidden most of the items around the world, eyes up guardian!

If you want to skip the search, I've added a command to give all items from my mod.  "givearmory"


<h3>IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS!!!!</h3>
DO NOT SAVE THE GAME WITH A MODDED WEAPON EQUIPPED, IT CAN SOFTLOCK THE GAME!!!!

If you save with a modded weapon equipped, loading that save will cause the next time you enter combat, to softlock the game.

If you have already saved the game with the modded weapon equipped, do not worry, you can remove the bug. 

1. To remove the bug, unequip the weapon, save the game, and then load that save.  Just remember to reequip the weapon for combat.

<h3>Mod Installation Instructions</h3>
After installing K2-EXOTICARMORY, it is recommended to reload the save, or enter a new area.  Items do not spawn, unless the level was changed after mod installation.


<h3>Mod Uninstallation Instructions</h3>
After Uninstalling K2-EXOTICARMORY, it is recommended, to close the game, as there may be some leftover code running, that may cause bugs.

If reinstalling K2-EXOTICARMORY, closing the game is almost required.  If not closed, the mod will not function properly.
